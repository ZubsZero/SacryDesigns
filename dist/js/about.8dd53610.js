I need to make work; I thought of my fashion and art skills. How does one even do this? Sometimes life throws you a curveball and it’s what you do with it that can change the world. It is in that moment that I thought to myself “I will get my hands dirty with arts crafts and order some fabric from my mom in D.R. Congo to get my small business off the ground” With a bit of passion and purpose, I did! The art of embracing imperfect. </p><p data-v-00d183cb> Handmade things are often considered ugly and scary, especially if sold by someone not known in a unfamiliar environment. But African Art and Fashion, fortunately for me, tell a beautiful and unforgettable story that goes far beyond cultures and traditions. Sacry Design is a symbol of inspiration to embrace lives with all its imperfections striving to improve from ugly to beautiful. </p></div></div></div>',1);function o(a,e,t,o,r,s){const d=(0,i.g2)("NavBarComp");return(0,i.uX)(),(0,i.CE)("div",null,[(0,i.bF)(d),n])}var r=t(5431),s={name:"AboutPage",components:{NavBarComp:r.A}},d=t(1241);const c=(0,d.A)(s,[["render",o],["__scopeId","data-v-00d183cb"]]);var l=c}}]);
